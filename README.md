## Hasihorp
   - HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version reuse and share.
   - Through Terraform work-flow we can easily provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.
   - Through Terraform we can manage low-level components like compute, storage and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
## Terraform

## Basic Workflow:
  1) Write Configuration: Define your infrastructure in .tf files.
  2) Initialize Terraform: Use terraform init to initialize the working directory and download the necessary provider plugins.
                           Provider file help you to connect cloud services. These are binaries
  4)  Plan: Run terraform plan to see what changes will be made based on the current configuration.
  5)  Apply: Execute terraform apply to apply the changes and provision resources.
  6)  Destroy: When no longer needed, you can run terraform destroy to clean up and delete the infrastructure.
